\begin{acknowledgements}      

First of all I would like to thank Prof. Dr. Adrian Paschke for supervising this thesis and thus enabling me to write my master thesis about the topic of complex event pattern mining. Whenever I had important questions or progress to show, he made space in his busy schedule for me to discuss preliminary results and ideas. For that I am very grateful since this has helped me determine my next steps numerous times. Furthermore I would like to thank both Dr. Tara Athan and Ahmad Hasan for their support during the early stages of my thesis. Their merciless feedback (which is the best kind of feedback) made sure that I was constantly asking myself the right questions and generally kept me on track. My exceptional gratitude goes to my close and generally awesome friend Kai-Fabius Pribyl, who actually took the time to proofread this thesis. Finally I would like to thank my parents for their continuous support throughout my life and the time of thesis especially. \\
