This chapter serves as a rather broad introduction to the topic of this thesis and provides motivation for the work.

\section{General Introduction and Motivation}
Almost any application domain of information systems has some data that is being generated. Data is available in many different forms. One of these forms are data streams. Data streams are not limited to the recent rise in popularity of video and audio streams. On the contrary the application domains that produce data in the form of streams are very diverse. They include for example constantly running business applications that log business activities and events, sensor networks that report usage data or devices that take measurements of physical quantities (such as temperature, pressure, humidity, etc...) at certain points of time. \newline
The fact that streams generate a constant stream of data and thus lead to a constantly growing database is a significant difference to classic applications of data mining in which there is a static (training) database. Despite that significant difference, many fields of interest in the context of static databases are also of interest for data streams. These areas include frequent patterns, predictive patterns, association rules, clustering and classification of the data entities. Approaches and algorithms that solve these problems for static databases, while by no means fully researched, are rather well known and evaluated. Applying these methods to data streams can present challenges and may demand many modifications due to the large and possibly infinite amounts of data produced by streams. Naturally, data mining methods for stream data must be especially fast, scalable and memory efficient. \newline
Apart from the additional, algorithmic constraints on memory and computation time, data streams also present conceptual challenges. In contrast to static databases streams may evolve over time, which can make it very difficult for algorithms to assess which past data of the stream should be considered when analyzing the currently incoming data. Recognizing these so called concept drifts is one challenge among many when processing or mining data streams. \newline
A suitable way to look at most data streaming scenarios is that of event streams. An event can be basically anything that happens in the real world, represented as an element of a data stream. Examples of this could be a rise in temperature that is reported by a sensor or an increase in the value of a stock, that is being traded at a stock market. These events are commonly referred to as basic or simple events. \newline
This thesis attempts to combine two research areas that are of interest in event streams: Complex Event Mining and Prediction. Complex events are structures that consist of multiple basic events with different relationships between each other. Discovering interesting complex event patterns can be tough, especially since there may be a lot of potential candidates. The discovery of complex events is related to the research area of pattern mining, since complex events are essentially large patterns, that are mined from basic events. Traditionally, pattern mining is often employed to extract knowledge or interesting correlations. The prediction of certain events in an ongoing event stream has many obvious use cases such as building early warning systems for hazardous events like power outages in power grids, failures in sensor networks or even natural disasters, such as earthquakes. \\
The idea to combine these two research area is rather simple. We aim to mine complex events from an event stream with the specific purpose of predicting future occurrences of a specific event type. When mining complex events we also want to consider semantic knowledge in addition to the data present in the stream. If the semantic knowledge about the underlying event stream contains information about the different event types it is possible to use that knowledge directly in the mining process. Semantic knowledge can take many different forms, a common one being an RDF-graph that can be examined using queries. \newline
Figure \ref{fig_approach} summarizes the basic idea of this thesis graphically. The underlying event stream is mined for complex events by a mining algorithm that will consider the information given in the stream as well as the semantic knowledge. The resulting complex events are then used as input for a model building algorithm, which will produce a predictive model.

\end{figure}

In terms of the very broad term of complex events this thesis will focus on the subtopic of episode pattern mining. Episodes are a specific kind of complex events and are formally defined in chapter \ref{chapter_related}. For now it is sufficient to know that episodes are essentially complex events in which single events or entire episodes can be combined using two operators: the conjunction and the sequence operator. Figure \ref{fig_simpleEpisodeExample} visualizes a simple episode pattern and example occurrences in a data stream.

	\caption{The top half visualizes an example episode pattern, which consist of a conjunction (A and B must both occur, but the order does not matter) and a sequence (C must occur after A and B). The bottom half shows two windows of an example stream, in which occurrences of the episode are shown in green.}

\end{figure}

Episodes are sequential patterns that have previously been mined from very long sequences, which makes them an appropriate mining target in event streams, since streams and sequences share the sequential nature. The only difference is that streams grow over time, whereas sequences have a fixed size.\\
%Instead of just analyzing all frequent episodes, this thesis will focus on finding predictive episodes, meaning episodes which can help to predict events occurring in the future. As already mentioned prediction of events is a highly relevant application area, since the potential benefits of well performing models are enormous.
The domain that will be used in the evaluation of this thesis is stock market prediction. Both predicting the overall direction of the stock market and predicting whether individual stocks will rise or fall are a difficult problems that have the obvious application of making profitable investments. \newline
The rest of the thesis is outlined as follows: Chapter \ref{chapter_related} introduces the basic terminology and reviews the related work, Chapter \ref{chapter_background} follows up with formal definitions and a more detailed introduction to episode mining. Chapter \ref{chapter_solutions} presents the suggested algorithms to mine predictive models for event streams using episodes and analyzes their complexities. Subsequently chapter \ref{chapter_evaluation} presents an extensive evaluation using real stock market data. Finally chapter \ref{chapter_conclusion} concludes the paper and mentions possible future work.


%TODO use this somewhere
%In contrast to other regression and forecasting methods, such as artificial neural networks, predictive episodes have the advantage that once they are discovered they can make ad-hoc predictions in a fast moving data-stream, whereas neural networks usually forecast the closing values of stock markets of the next day based on the values of previous days. This gives predictive episodes a niche: fast moving (real-time) data-streams that need quick predictions of future events. \newline

\section{Problem Definition and Exact Research Question}
Even though many terms have not yet been precisely defined (which will be done in chapter \ref{chapter_related} ) this section presents a loose, intuitive definition of the problem to be tackled by this thesis. Given a stream of basic events and a special event type $P$ one is interested to predict occurrences of that special event type $P$ in the stream, so that actions can be taken before $P$ actually occurs. For this purpose we are interested to discover episodes in the stream of which occurrences are temporally correlated to the occurrence of $P$. A window of an example stream is visualized in figure \ref{fig_predictiveEpisodeExample}. In this simple example the episode $A$ followed by $E$ always occurs before $P$.

\begin{figure}[h]
	\centering
  	\includegraphics[width=0.6\textwidth]{examplePrediction.jpg}
	\caption{The figure visualizes an event stream in which events of type $P$ are to be predicted. The occurrences of the episode $A$ followed by $E$ is colored in teal, whereas events of types $P$ are colored in green and all other events are yellow}
	\label{fig_predictiveEpisodeExample}
\end{figure}

Note that it is very important to the mining process how much time is allowed to pass between the occurrence of the mined episode and the event that is to predict. If this time span is too small a mining algorithm might not find reliable correlations. If the timespan is too large a mining algorithm might be overwhelmed by the number of candidates that need to be considered, since the more time may pass the larger are the sequences before each event $P$ that must be considered. %TODO maybe move the last sentences to method? 
\newline
To solve the problem outlined above a semantic mining algorithm will be suggested in this thesis. Since the underlying data structure to be analyzed are data streams, the algorithm must have the following properties:
\begin{itemize}
	\item The algorithm must be able to adapt to a changing context (as the stream progresses, the underlying correlation may change completely)
	\item The recognition of episodes must be quick, since streams, especially in the domain of stock markets, can have a high velocity. This makes it important to be able to quickly predict events. If the prediction takes too long, the event which we want to predict may have already occurred before the algorithm outputs its prediction, thus robbing the user of the opportunity to take action.
	\item The Algorithm must not require to store the entire stream of events seen so far, since that is not feasible for most streams.
\end{itemize}

The algorithm will be evaluated on real-life data-sets from the domain of stock market prediction, in which the developed algorithm will be empirically compared to other approaches in terms of accuracy measures and execution time. In summary the research question in particular is:\newline \newline
\textbf{How can event streams be mined for episodes that help predict certain event types and how can domain knowledge be used to improve the results of the mining algorithm?}
