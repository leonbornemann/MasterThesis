Pattern mining in categorical event streams is a challenging research area of data mining that aims to mine meaningful or useful patterns from ongoing data streams. This thesis deals with the discovery of complex event patterns, which combine multiple basic events using specific operators. The discovered patterns are then used to predict future events in the stream. In particular the mining of frequent episodes is studied. The thesis proposes two algorithms to build predictive models in categorical event streams, called Predictive Episode Rule Mining and Feature Based Stream Window classification. These algorithms mine frequent episodes from an ongoing event stream, train predictive models based on the discovered episode patterns and then apply these models to the stream. The proposed algorithms are evaluated on financial data streams in order to predict the direction of stock market movements.
